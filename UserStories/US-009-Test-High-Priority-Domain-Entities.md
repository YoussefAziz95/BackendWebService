# US-009: Write Unit Tests for High-Priority Domain Entities

**As a** Developer  
**I want to** write comprehensive unit tests for all high-priority Domain entities  
**So that** the most critical business logic is validated and protected

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Identify all high-priority entities from the catalog created in US-008
2. For each high-priority entity:
   - Create a dedicated test class
   - Write tests for all constructors
   - Write tests for all properties with validation
   - Write tests for all business methods
   - Write tests for edge cases and boundary conditions
3. Follow the testing standards documented in US-007
4. Ensure each entity achieves minimum 80% code coverage
5. All tests pass successfully
6. Generate coverage report showing high-priority entities coverage
7. Update tracking document with testing status
8. No compiler warnings or errors
9. Tests execute efficiently (reasonable execution time)

## Definition of Done

- All high-priority Domain entities have comprehensive unit tests
- All tests pass
- Coverage targets are met for each entity
- Tracking document is updated
- Code review is completed
- Tests follow established patterns and standards

## Priority

**High** - Covers most critical business logic

## Estimated Effort

2-4 weeks (depending on number of high-priority entities)
