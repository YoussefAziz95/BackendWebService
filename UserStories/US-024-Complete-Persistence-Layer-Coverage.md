# US-024: Complete Persistence Layer Test Coverage

**As a** Developer  
**I want to** finalize Persistence layer testing and validate coverage  
**So that** the Persistence layer meets quality standards

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Review Persistence layer coverage report
2. Identify any gaps in test coverage
3. Write additional tests for uncovered custom logic
4. Verify overall Persistence layer coverage meets 70%+ threshold (lower than other layers due to framework code)
5. All tests pass
6. Generate final Persistence coverage report
7. Update tracking document showing completion
8. Document testing approach and any excluded code
9. Review test suite for maintainability

## Definition of Done

- Persistence layer coverage meets target threshold
- All custom repository logic is tested
- Coverage report is generated
- All tests pass
- Tracking document shows completion
- Exclusions are documented and justified

## Priority

**High** - Completes Persistence layer testing

## Estimated Effort

1 week
