**As a** Developer  
**I want to** establish a plan for maintaining and evolving the test suite  
**So that** tests remain valuable and don't become a burden

## Acceptance Criteria

   - Who maintains tests when code changes
   - Who reviews test quality in code reviews
   - Who monitors test execution times
2. Establish practices for test evolution:
   - When to add new tests
   - When to update existing tests
   - When to remove obsolete tests
   - How to refactor test code
3. Define test review criteria:
   - Checklist for reviewing test code
   - Standards for test quality
   - Guidelines for test naming and organization
4. Create monitoring plan:
   - Track test execution times
   - Track flaky tests
   - Track coverage trends
5. Plan for handling test issues:
   - How to address flaky tests
   - How to handle slow tests
   - How to maintain test data
6. Document onboarding process for new developers
