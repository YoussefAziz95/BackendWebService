# US-011: Write Unit Tests for Remaining Domain Entities

**As a** Developer  
**I want to** write unit tests for all remaining Domain entities  
**So that** the Domain layer achieves comprehensive test coverage

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Identify all remaining untested Domain entities
2. For each remaining entity:
   - Create test class
   - Write tests for key functionality
   - Focus on validation and core behavior
3. Target minimum 70% coverage for simple entities
4. All tests pass successfully
5. Generate final Domain layer coverage report
6. Verify overall Domain layer coverage meets 80%+ threshold
7. Update tracking document to show 100% entities covered
8. Review test suite for any gaps or missing scenarios
9. Document any entities that are untestable or excluded with justification

## Definition of Done

- All Domain entities have corresponding unit tests
- Overall Domain layer coverage meets or exceeds 80%
- All tests pass
- No untested critical logic remains
- Documentation explains any coverage gaps
- Tracking document shows complete Domain layer coverage

## Priority

**Medium** - Completes Domain layer testing

## Estimated Effort

1-2 weeks
