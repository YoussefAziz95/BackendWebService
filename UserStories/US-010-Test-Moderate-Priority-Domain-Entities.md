# US-010: Write Unit Tests for Moderate-Priority Domain Entities

**As a** Developer  
**I want to** write unit tests for all moderate-priority Domain entities  
**So that** I expand coverage to additional business logic

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Identify all moderate-priority entities from the catalog
2. For each moderate-priority entity:
   - Create a dedicated test class
   - Write tests covering key scenarios and logic
   - Write tests for validation rules
   - Write tests for important edge cases
3. Follow established testing standards
4. Target minimum 75% code coverage for moderate-priority entities
5. All tests pass successfully
6. Generate updated coverage report
7. Update tracking document with progress
8. Review and refactor any complex test code for maintainability

## Definition of Done

- All moderate-priority Domain entities have unit tests
- Coverage targets are achieved
- All tests pass
- Tracking document reflects current status
- No technical debt in test code

## Priority

**Medium** - Important for comprehensive Domain coverage

## Estimated Effort

2-3 weeks (depending on number of moderate-priority entities)
